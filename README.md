# US County Population Visualization

An interactive visualization that compares US county populations to major world cities. Hover over any county to see surrounding counties that together equal a selected city's population.

Inspired by [Derek Camp's LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/derek-camp_map-monday-population-of-new-york-city-activity-7355575328552980486-sbhQ) showing New York City's population compared to surrounding counties.
